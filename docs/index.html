    <h1>On `monsweeper`</h1>
    <p>
        Monsweeper was a project I did for a take-home interview. I had to write it in Elixir, which I had a little
        familiarity with, but not a lot of experience. It came with a deadline, so I had to be effective in using my
        time. To start out, that wasn't really the case. I chose the RPG option, immediately thinking of making a
        dungeon crawler. Upon a quick look on Github though, it turns out that this was already thought of -- creating a
        dungeon crawler is an exercise from a book! That is to say, there's multiple identical copies of this Elixir
        Dungeon Crawler up there. I wanted mine to be unique, so I kept thinking. I decided on making more of a
        text-based game, inspired by Chinatown (and using some dialogue lifted directly from the script). Early on, I
        realized how much writing that would be, so I pivoted again. Palworld had just come out, so I thought about
        making something Pokemon related. I don't know how the idea to do a Minesweeper inspired game came along, but it
        came to me. The idea was to have it resemble a dungeon crawler without actually being a dungeon crawler. There
        was still a randomized component, that being the placement of the Electrodes (the "mines"), but I figured it
        would be straightforward enough to complete in a couple days, which was the goal. It was interesting
        experimenting with immutable state, but it didn't cause me as many issues as I expected. Neither did the
        recursion. Using guard functions to model different outcomes made a lot of sense. I did lean on the previously
        mentioned repositories on Github as a model for what I could do, and
        that made it a lot easier. This helped me correctly model the data (Mon, Turn, Grass), and everything sort of
        fell into place after that. I did have trouble running it though, and I wish I had a better solution than what's
        in the readme, but that's all the time I had.
